I need to know what foodbanks are closest to me  (walking distance?/modes of transportation)
Element 1: I will have to input my address (input form) (Bootstrap?) that is saved in local storage
Element 2: use information from local storage and Search API charity list by zipcode/parent address
Element 3: take original address and Charity address information and put it into a location search
Element 4: output walking distance

5. Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming, etc.)
6. Must Not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into <i>modals</i>)
